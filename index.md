i spend my time Reading, working as a wilderness EMT, and going to school for Philosophy and emergency medicine.
when i make art i do not often put it under my own name.
if you found this page you were probably looking for me, feel free to reach out at < \[firstnamelastname\] at gmail dot com >.
good luck on your further travels through Cyberia, please take this ward with you on your digital journey:
```
let go your earthly tether
enter the void,
empty and become wind
```
